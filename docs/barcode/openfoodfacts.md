# OpenFoodFacts API
- __This will be the API used going forward, based on available information and cost__
- Open source repository of food and nutritional information, which can be indexed by barcode
- __NOTE__: There is no restriction on rate limits; however, this will be a scalability issue - don't want to be reliant on a potentially overused product. As OpenFoodFacts offers the entirety of their databse in mutliple file formats (.CSV), we may need to load in the data into our own and make an affiliated API.
